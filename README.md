# drawdown_tracker

This repository contains two tools designed to help monitor and analyze market drawdowns.

1. tracker.py

This script sends an email with the current drawdown from the all-time high of a selected instrument.
I run this every morning to receive an automatic notification showing how far below its historical peak the instrument currently is.

2. drawdown_analysis.py

This script analyzes historical price data and reports all drawdowns greater than a specified percentage over a given date range.
I use it to understand the historical behavior of an instrument — specifically, how deep previous drawdowns have been and how often they occur.
